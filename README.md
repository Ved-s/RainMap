## RainMap

Tool created to quickly load, preview and render regions.

#### Usage

When started, RainMap will ask to open region folder (for example `Rain World/World/Regions/SU`), then it will try to locate RainWorld.exe and all needed assets then load region rooms.

When all rooms are loaded, you can:

- Pan around using right mouse button
- Zoom using mouse wheel
- Select and move rooms using right mouse button

- Press F5 to switch room layer visibility
- Press F6 to switch room tile layer visibility
- Press F8 to start region rendering

    RainMap will ask for result file path then start rendering all rooms into single image file
    
    All visible layers at the moment os starting the render will be visible in the final render
