## RainMap

Tool created to quickly load, preview and render regions.

### Usage

When started, RainMap will ask to open region folder (for example `Rain World/World/Regions/SU`), then it will try to locate RainWorld.exe and all needed assets then load region rooms.

Then it can be configured in its interface.
